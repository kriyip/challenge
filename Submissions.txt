3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
    The largest challenge I faced was with some of the styling; in particular, I had some difficulties with changing the background colors of the radio buttons due to the way that I structured the DOM tree. I got over this issue by researching the documentation for some workarounds.
